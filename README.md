# Conditional Neural Expert Processes (CNEP)

This repository contains the source code for the paper "Conditional Neural Expert Processes for Learning from Demonstration" by [Yigit Yildirim](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~yigit.yildirim/) and [Emre Ugur](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~emre). We both are members of the [CoLoRs Lab, Bogazici University](https://clrslab.wordpress.com/).

CNEP is a novel deep learning architecture for Learning from Demonstration (LfD) in robotics aiming to encode diverse sensorimotor trajectories from demonstrations with varying movements, leveraging a novel gating mechanism, multiple decoders, and an entropy-based loss calculation to promote decoder specialization.
